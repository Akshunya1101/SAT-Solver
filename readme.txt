Final submission folder contains 9 files - a readme file (readme.txt), a Brief report file (Brief report.txt), the solution code file (main.py), output file (output.txt)
                                           and 5 input files named as uf20-01 , uf50-01 , uf50-02 , uuf50-01 , uuf50-02 .

The code logic is explained in detail in the Brief report file.
You have to open the python code file.
Before running the file you have to set the file you want to take input from by following below steps-
1. Go to line 45.
2. change the name of input file as desired. For example if you want to use input file "uf50-01.cnf" then change line 45 as "    f = open("uf50-01.cnf") "  with proper indentation.

Now you can run the python file. Final truth values of all the literals can be found in output file (output.txt).
If the value is positive. That means that literal holds true in final model.
If the value is negative. That means that literal holds false in final model.
